Example
A new Flutter project demonstrating the use of the Firebase Storage Manager package.

Getting Started
This project serves as a starting point for integrating Firebase Storage Manager into a Flutter application. Below are a few resources and steps to get you started.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Flutter and Dart.
A Flutter environment set up. For setup details, see the Flutter documentation.
Adding Localizations Delegate
The package uses localizations for providing multilingual support. To ensure these localizations work correctly in your application, you need to add the UploaderLocalizationsDelegate to your MaterialApp widget:

dart
Copy code
MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    UploaderLocalizationsDelegate(),
    // ... other delegates ...
  ],
  // ... other MaterialApp properties ...
);
Configuring Firebase Storage Rules
For CRUD operations to work correctly, your Firebase Storage rules need to be set up properly. This is crucial for both security and functionality. Here's an example of how your Firebase Storage rules might look:

plaintext
Copy code
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      // Replace with your specific authentication condition
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.email == 'your-email@example.com';
    }
  }
}
This example rule allows only authenticated users with a specific email to read and write to the storage. Adjust the rules according to your requirements.

Example Usage
The following is an example of how to use the Firebase Storage Manager in a Flutter application:

dart
Copy code
// ... existing imports ...

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  Bloc.observer = const AppBlocObserver();

  // Initialize Firebase
  await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // ... MaterialApp with UploaderLocalizationsDelegate ...
}

class UploaderPage extends StatelessWidget {
  // ... UploaderPage implementation ...
}

class SignInPage extends StatefulWidget {
  // ... SignInPage implementation ...
}
